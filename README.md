# fullscreen-message
A command-line tool to show big messages across the entire screen which can be closed with any key press.

## Motivation
Finding notifications at the side of your screen can be a pain. It *is* useful when multitasking but sometimes you want somethign simple.


## Usage
```
fullscreen-message 'Hello world'
```

## Alternatives and prior work
I found a PyPI package called [fullscreen-alert](https://pypi.org/project/fullscreen-alert/) which does somethign similar, but it didn't have my documentation and seemed to be a module rather than a command-line tool.

For the shell, you tools like [figlet](http://www.figlet.org/) to draw big messages.
